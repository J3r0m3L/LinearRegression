Linear Regression (Gradient Descent): Machine Learning Technique
-Use gradient descent (sum of squared error) to get the line of best fit
-Linear Regression is machine learning not deep learning
-Sum of squared errors is taken from the distance from the points to best-fit line
  -Look up a picture of equation cuz its too hard to write in a .txt file
